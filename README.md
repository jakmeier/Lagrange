# Jakob's blog

A small blog where I write about whatever crosses my mind.
Usually, it involves some programming.

The blog itself is over at [www.jakobmeier.ch](https://www.jakobmeier.ch).

## Follow me

Sorry, I don't do a lot of social media.
If you would like to be notified when I upload a new blog, feel free to watch this repository or [follow my user on github](https://github.com/jakmeier).

## Lagrange Template

This blog is based on the [Lagrange template](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange).

Lagrange is a minimalist Jekyll theme for running a personal blog or site for free through [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), or on your own server. Everything that you will ever need to know about this Jekyll theme is included in the [README](https://github.com/LeNPaul/Lagrange/blob/gh-pages/README.md), which you can also find in [the demo site](https://lenpaul.github.io/Lagrange/).
