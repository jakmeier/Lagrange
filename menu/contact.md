My name is Jakob Meier and I like programming and building computer systems.
I strongly believe in open-source and think this is the best way to move humanity forward as a whole.

Currently, I'm a student in computer science at <a href="https://www.ethz.ch">ETHZ</a>, enrolled in the MSc. course since fall 2018.
During the day, I am reverse-engineering a CPU L2 cache coherence protocol as part of my ongoing master thesis. At night, I play around with hobby projects and sometimes write something about in on this blog.

Feel free to contact me for any matter using my email <a href="mailto:{{ site.data.settings.email }}">{{ site.data.settings.email }}</a>.
