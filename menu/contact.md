My name is Jakob Meier and I like programming and building computer systems.

I've recently finished my master's degree in computer science at <a href="https://www.ethz.ch">ETHZ</a> and from June 2020 onwards I will be working full-time as a graduate engineer.

When I have some extra time, I like to play around with hobby projects, which often involve some programming.
The code is always open-source and usually available publicly on my <a href=https://github.com/jakmeier/>github</a> profile.
Sometimes, I write about the projects on this blog.

Feel free to contact me for any matter using my email <a href="mailto:{{ site.data.settings.email }}">{{ site.data.settings.email }}</a>.
