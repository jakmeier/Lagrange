<p class="intro">Have you ever spent time writing boilerplate code around enums? With Rust, you don't have to!</p>

In this article, I want to show how easy it has become in Rust to use a single enum type across many application domains.
From SQL databases, through a web server and a GraphQL interface, all the way to a web client, we will use a single enum definition and zero boilerplate code.

Why should you care? I can think of many reasons but the most profound one is that enum modifications become super simple. Just add or remove a variant in the single definition and it's done.
No need to update serialization code and no chance for server and client source code to diverge.

Sounds good? Then let me give you the full code up-front. 
```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Clone, Copy)]
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
#[serde(rename_all = "SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE")] 
#[cfg_attr(feature = "enum_utils", derive(EnumIter, Display))]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "graphql", derive(juniper::GraphQLEnum))]
#[cfg_attr(feature = "sql_db", derive(DbEnum), DieselType = "Duck_color")]
pub enum DuckColor {
    Yellow,
    White,
    Camo,
}
```

Wow, that surely is a lot of attributes!
Now imagine having to write several lines of boring code for each of those attributes. Over and over again, for every enum you define.
I for one, much prefer to have these attributes instead.
But what are they? I will give a full explanation in the remainder of the article.

## Some context around the case study
This enum `DuckColor` is a real example from one of my hobby projects, a browser game called [Paddlers](https://github.com/jakmeier/paddlers-browser-game).
The Paddlers (a.k.a. poorly drawn ducks) are the main characters of the game. This enum defines which sprite a particular duck/Paddler uses.

![Three ducks with different colors.](/assets/img/21/ducks.svg)

<!-- Here is a struct definition that uses the enum. -->
```rust
pub struct Duck {
    pub id: i64,
    pub color: DuckColor,
    pub level: i32,
}
```

This is the last full struct you will see in this article. I will completely zoom in and only talk about enums from here onwards.
Anything that is not directly related to them, I will glance over.
<!-- This focus makes it easier for me to stay on point and keep the article at a decent length. -->
<!-- But if you  -->
<!-- I will try to give  and might be difficult to understand if you have no idea what GraphQL is, or  -->
 <!-- example code might feel a bit draw -->
<!-- elaborate examples. -->

Should you find yourself wondering about some of the actual implementation details around the examples I present, fear not for I have you covered as well.

Previously, I wrote an article called [Benefits of Full-Stack Rust](https://www.jakobmeier.ch/blogging/Paddlers_4.html) where I explain in detail how I make the different components of the game work together nicely.
It has more complete code examples and explains the concept of full-stack Rust much better than the article you are reading right now.
<!-- While I tried to make this article  -->
<!-- It even talks a bit about enums, but not in full glory as I'm about to do right here. -->
<!-- Go and read that other article first, if you are interested in more context and clearer examples. -->
<!-- A multiplayer browser game is a fairly complex system with several applications communicating with each other.
This enum has to be understood by every component in the system.
And the data has to be both transmitted and persisted. -->

## Sharing between multiple Rust applications
Before tackling the attributes, we need to quickly address how an enum can be shared across even just two applications.
In our case, we have a web client and a web server. Both are written in Rust but compiled to WebAssembly and x86_64 respectively.


Those two crates have completely different dependencies and neither depends on the other.
But they want to share an enum type, rather than duplicate the code.
Luckily, the solution is simple. Just use a third crate that both crates can depend on.
Here is a diagram of this highly complex situation.

![A simple diagram with client and server pointing to the shared library.](/assets/img/21/shared_lib.svg#center)

Defining the enum `DuckColor` in this shared library makes it possible to share in all our other Rust crates.
<!-- The code written in the shared library is accessible by both client and server -->
All good so far? Then let's take on the long list of attributes.

## Derive Macros on Enums
If you have some Rust experience, you have most likely seen these derive macros before.
<!-- This is a set of fairly common derives that I use on many enums. -->
```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Eq, Hash, Clone, Copy)]
```
`Debug` makes it work in `println!("{:?}", DuckColor::Camo)`, `PartialEq` is for `==`, `Eq` + `Hash` are needed to use the enum as a `HashMap` key, and finally, `Clone` + `Copy` lets me avoid borrowing all the time.

These are all built into the language.
But what makes Rust immensely flexible is the option to create your own [procedural macros](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/procedural-macros.html).
That is, a macro that can be written in Rust, takes Rust code as input, and generates some other Rust code.

Derive macros are just one shape of procedural macros and they are very useful on enums.
The crate [enum-utils](https://github.com/ecstatic-morse/enum-utils) provides the perfect example for this.
With `#[derive(EnumIter)]`, it becomes possible to iterate over all variants of an enum.
```rust
for col in DuckColor::iter() {
    println!("{:?}", col);
}
/* Output is 3 lines: */
// Yellow
// White
// Camo
```
<!-- The same crate also has utilities to provide a static string for each enum variant. -->

Of course, this can also be done in languages other than Rust. But usually, it involves a lot of boilerplate code.
Having it solved once and for all in a macro, and then being able to share it through [crates.io](crates.io) is just so much better.

Crate maintainers are typically pretty good at providing these macros where it makes sense. I actually have come to expect that they exist and feel disappointed when I don't find them in the docs of a crate. Let's have a look at some examples where I have not been disappointed.

![An illustration showing a duck being sent through a network.](/assets/img/21/enum_transmission.svg)
## Transmitting an Enum through HTTP
<!-- Having a shared type is not that useful by itself. -->
To transfer an enum through a network, data has to be serialized on the sender side and deserialized by the receiver.
[Serde](https://serde.rs) is by far the most popular library for this task in Rust.

A great strength of Serde is its elaborate derive macro support.
It is highly configurable and works with pretty much all commonly used formats.

For enums, if I want each variant to serialize as its name in string format, I can just use `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]` on it.
<!-- I could implement any wild strategy that I can think of by hand. -->
<!-- In the code presented at the begging, `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]` are the Serde derivations. -->
<!-- This simply uses the variant names in string format for their textual representation. -->
In my case, I want it to be transformed to upper case with underscores.
For that I also add `#[serde(rename_all = "SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE")]`.

### REST API
The game Paddlers has a simple REST API that uses a JSON format on the network.
Creating a JSON string with Serde looks like this:

```rust
let col: DuckColor = DuckColor::Yellow;
let json_string = serde_json::to_string(&col)?;
assert_eq!("\"YELLOW\"", json_string);
```

And a JSON string can equally easily be parsed back into a Rust type.
```rust
let parsed_col: DuckColor = serde_json::from_str(&json_string)?;
assert_eq!(parsed_col, DuckColor::Yellow);
```

<!-- To make this possible, I have to add the `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]` annotation to the enum.
This calls the two derive macros [Serialze](https://docs.rs/serde_derive/1.0.124/serde_derive/derive.Serialize.html) and [Deserialze](https://docs.rs/serde_derive/1.0.124/serde_derive/derive.Deserialize.html) on the enum source code and generates the necessary code for the equally named traits [Serialize](https://docs.serde.rs/serde/ser/trait.Serialize.html) and [Deserialize](https://docs.serde.rs/serde/ser/trait.Deserialize.html).

But the macro needs to know how to deserialize each field. For primitive types, like `i32`, Serde already knows how to do it.
For the types I defined myself, like `DuckColor`, I have to be explicit about the strategy that should be used.
I could implement any wild strategy that I can think of by hand.
If I just want the variant name in string format, so I can use `#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]` also on the enum.

In my case, I want it to be the name in string format but transformed to all upper case with underscores.
For that I also add `#[serde(rename_all = "SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE")]` and I'm done. -->

### GraphQL Server
The game also has a second API, which uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/).
 <!-- to define well-defined and strongly typed interface that I can implement the client against. -->
I'm using [Juniper](https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper), which allows me to specify a GraphQL schema in pure Rust code. Juniper then manages the GraphQL server that responds to incoming queries.

GraphQL has native support for enums.
That is to say, a GraphQL schema can define an enum type and a list of strings that are valid for that enum.
To connect this to Rust, I allow Juniper to generate my schema based on the `enum DuckColor`, using the attribute `#[derive(juniper::GraphQLEnum)]`.
This generates this GraphQL type:
```graphql
enum DuckColor {
    YELLOW
    WHITE
    CAMO
}
```

So far so good, there is only one problem. I have to add the derive on the enum, which is defined in the shared library. That means the shared library has to depend on Juniper!
Not ideal, since the client also depends on the library, which has no intention of using Juniper.

Of course, Rust has an elegant solution for this as well.
The shared library can have an optional dependency on Juniper and define a feature that only the server uses.

```toml
# Cargo.toml of shared library
[dependencies]
juniper = { version = "0.15", optional = true }
[features]
graphql = ["juniper"]
```

```toml
# Cargo.toml of server
[dependencies]
shared-lib = { path = "../shared-lib", features = ["graphql"] }
juniper = "0.15"
```
Finally, the derive macro needs to be hidden behind [conditional compilation flags](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/conditional-compilation.html) like so:
```rust
#[cfg_attr(feature = "graphql", derive(juniper::GraphQLEnum))]
pub enum DuckColor {
    Yellow,
    White,
    Camo,
}
```

### GraphQL Client
The last puzzle piece for consistent network transmission is the GraphQL client.
I'm using the Rust crate called [graphql-client](https://github.com/graphql-rust/graphql-client) for this.
When you feed it with GraphQL queries, it spits out Rust code.

The generated code from graphql-client can be used to send queries to the server and parse the responses directly into proper Rust structs.
These structs are generated from the query and validated against the GraphQL schema, which in turn can be extracted from Juniper.

Going back to enums, what graphql-client does by default with them is to generate a new enum type on the fly that matches the schema definition. 
That is generally a nice thing but not ideal in the situation at hand. Here, we would rather use the enum type defined in the shared library directly, or else we need an extra translation step.

Until a week ago, I had this extra translation step in Paddlers. But a small [pull request](https://github.com/graphql-rust/graphql-client/pull/359) later, it is now possible to specify an enum that should be used for deserialization instead of generating one anew.

The code for this is not on the enum type directly but rather on the generated query.
It uses `#[derive(GraphQLQuery)]` to trigger the procedural macro and then the attribute macro `#[graphql(...)]` to configure the code generation.

```rust
#[derive(GraphQLQuery)]
#[graphql(
    schema_path = "api/schema.json",
    query_path = "api/queries/ducks_query.graphql",
    extern_enums("DuckColor")
)]
pub struct DucksQuery;
```

Once again, the flexibility of procedural macros allows me to skip writing repetitive code for simple tasks.

![An illustration showing a ducks stored in a database.](/assets/img/21/enum_database.svg#center)
## PostgreSQL Database
<!-- So far we connected the server and the client and they can effectively share the same type definitions. -->
The last point to tackle is the database. I'm using PostgreSQL, which has great [native enum support](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/datatype-enum.html).
Enum values are strings in SQL queries and in the returned data. Of course, all strings are validated against the enum definition.
To keep things consistent, we just need a way to link between database enums and Rust enums.

[Diesel](https://diesel.rs/) is the ORM I use to link all SQL tables to Rust structs. It also validates the types of my queries.
But the important bit for this article is the derive macro `#[derive(DbEnum)]`.
With that, an enum column in the SQL table is automatically converted to its Rust equivalent when loading data.

By default, the type names must match exactly. But with the attribute `#[DieselType = "Duck_color"]`, the link can be made to a differently named type.

Awesome, now all components respect one single enum definition!
When I add or remove a variant in the definition, all parts of the system are updated automatically.
Except....

Oh dear, what about the data in the database? What happens to existing ducks with the `DuckColor::White` when I replace that color with `DuckColor::Grey`?
Should it update the rows? Or set the color to null? Or even delete the rows?

My point is, the database needs special attention in the case of an enum modification.
A small migration SQL query will be necessary.

I don't see any way Rust could help us out here. And I'm perfectly fine with that.
This is not boilerplate code in my books, it is in fact code that requires thinking.
Potentially even a meeting with the data owners to discuss the different consequences.

Maybe we could have generated suggestions for migrations scripts, based on what changed in Rust code. I think that could be helpful.
But please, never automatically update my data just because I make small code changes!

So yeah, this is pretty much the limit of how tightly we can couple enumerations across application boundaries as of today.
I'm pretty happy with that.


## Final thoughts
I love enums.
For me, they are the most iconic example of what programming is:
Using a written language to express bits and addresses in a way that both computer and humans can understand.
More concretely, we as humans can imagine the ducks in different colors and the computer can think `0`, `1`, `10`.

And yet, I find support for enums in most languages very poor.
Python added enums with version 3.4 and JavaScript still doesn't have them.

Okay, maybe dynamically-typed languages fundamentally don't try to help prevent programmers from making stupid mistakes like comparing `Company::Apple` with `Fruit::Apple`.

What about statically typed languages?
Well, C has enums since 1972 and it existed in other languages before that. But a modern language like Go still gets away without them!

Then what about traditional OOP languages like C++, Java?
They at least support the C-style enums.
Additionally, enums are type-checked and not just another way to define constant integers, which is pretty much what C does.

Both C++ and Java also added some more bells and whistles over time.
For example, modern C++ has [scoped enums](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/enum) (defined using `enum class`) that behave a bit more sanely than normal `enum`.

Java even lets you define methods on enums, a feature which I haven't seen much outside of Rust.
And Java ships some useful built-in methods like `DuckColor.values()` which returns an array of all variants.
Not too bad.

But even if you use the newest version of Java and especially C++, be prepared to bring your own boilerplate code for many use cases.

Rust embraces the idea of enums and multiplies it with the concept of tagged unions and pattern matching.
Add the flexibility of procedural macros and combine it with a nice package manager, and you have one more reason why Rust is the future.
