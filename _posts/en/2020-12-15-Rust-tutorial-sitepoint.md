An editor from [SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/) reached out to me, asking me if I can write an article for them.
They have decided to add some Rust content and wanted me to write an introduction to the language.

To make a long story short, [the article](https://www.sitepoint.com/rust-tutorial-introduction-javascript-devs/) has now been published. It is primarily directed towards JavaScript programmers with little to no Rust experience.
But it should also be a good read for Rust experts who have not looked at Webassembly, yet.
If that is not enough to convince you, there is also a nice little demo consisting of a live Corona simulation web app that can switch between Rust and JavaScript implementations with a simple slider.
